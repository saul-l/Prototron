# Prototron

Work in progress Robotron inspired game project on Unity 2021


Windows/Mac platform requires Wwise 2022.1.0 plugin for Unity.

WebGL platform works without Wwise integration.

If you have no idea what this means, switch platform to WebGL.


Audio and texture data uses Git LFS, so direct download link from GitHub doesn't work.

Install Git LFS and Use git clone.


If you are looking for Wwise-Unity native audio wrapper it's here:

(Proper release coming when it has more features.)
