# Prototron

Work in progress Robotron inspired game project on Unity 2021

Non WebGL build audio requires installing Wwise 2022.1.0 plugin for Unity.
WebGL build works without Wwise integration. 

Audio and texture data uses Git LFS, so direct download link from GitHub doesn't work.
Install Git LFS and Use git clone.

If you are looking for Wwise-Unity native audio wrapper it's here:

(Proper release coming when it has more features.)
